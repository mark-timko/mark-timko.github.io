      It is a pleasure to have you on my webpage. My name is Mark Timko, currently
      a student of Computer Science. I was previously studying Media Management,
      and am working to become the best programmer I can be, starting in Web Development
      and pushing forward from there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once I graduate, I'd like to begin in the field of either data science or
      cybersecurity. It has been a great interest of mine, and I have been
      incredibly excited to get to work. I have been working with computers and
      teaching myself about all that I can for longer than a decade, and part of
      my motivation stems from the chance to learn about new things in the field
      much more in depth than I had been learning previously.
